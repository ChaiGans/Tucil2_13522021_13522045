## General Information
This program is designed to construct Bézier curves using a midpoint algorithm based on divide and conquer principles. It enables users to create linear, quadratic, quartic, and higher-order curves by entering the desired control points. The application provides two algorithmic solutions: a brute force approach limited to 3 control points and a divide and conquer approach for n control points. Users can evaluate the efficiency of each algorithm by comparing the execution time required to solve a problem. The program features a user-friendly GUI that facilitates interaction, offering choices for the user to select the desired algorithm for problem-solving.

## How To Run
1. Clone this repository :
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ChaiGans/Tucil2_13522021_13522045.git
```

2. Navigate to the `src` directory:
```shell
cd .\Tucil2_13522021_13522045\
cd src
python main.py
```
Upon successful execution, a splash screen will appear!

## How To Use Program
1. Once the program is running, a GUI splash screen will appear, indicating readiness for use.
2. First, select the algorithm you wish to use to create the Bézier curve.
3. Enter the number of control points for constructing the Bézier curve.
4. Input the control points in the format (x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3),... with no spaces or additional symbols. Follow the format guidance in the error log if necessary.
5. Enter the number of iterations desired to refine the Bézier   curve.
6. Finally, click the 'Generate' button to start creating the Bezier curve with the provided information.
